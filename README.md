# üì® Email Spam Detection

## Project ID
**20945480**

## Overview
The Email Spam Detection project focuses on effectively categorizing incoming emails into spam and non-spam classes using machine learning techniques. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various classification algorithms, the project aims to enhance email filtering systems.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:
- **[SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/code)**

## üì¶ Required Packages
To run the project, ensure the following Python packages are installed:
- `pandas`
- `re`
- `nltk`
- `sklearn`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `tqdm`
- `time`

## üîç Key Operations Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis to ensure accurate results.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Applying techniques to extract meaningful features from the text, improving model performance.
3. **Classification**: Implementing Logistic Regression as the primary classification model to achieve high accuracy on the text data.
4. **Visualization**: Utilizing a heatmap to visualize the confusion matrix, providing insights into the model's performance.
5. **Classification Report**: Generating a detailed classification report to evaluate key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìä Methodology
### Other Key Steps to Spam Mail Detection:
- **Email Filtering**: The primary method for spam detection, which categorizes incoming emails based on content and metadata.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Essential for understanding and processing human language, allowing for feature extraction from emails.
- **Text Classification**: A supervised learning approach that labels emails as spam or non-spam based on their features, such as the presence of specific keywords and the overall tone.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features from emails, including the sender's address, specific words or phrases, and email length, to enhance classification.
- **Supervised Learning**: Training models on labeled data to predict the categories of new, unlabeled emails.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding hidden patterns in the data without labeled examples, which can be useful for anomaly detection and clustering.
- **Deep Learning**: Employing deep neural networks to learn complex features from the data, demonstrating great potential in spam detection tasks.
- **Neural Networks**: Utilizing models inspired by the human brain to effectively classify emails as spam or non-spam based on extracted features.
